										<b>Luxury Burlesque Accessories</b>, bespoke or readymade, all hand-made with the highest quality materials and all the love a girl can put into little things!
										<p/>Specialist in bespoke tassels and pasties.
										<p/>Well hello there! My name is Ruby. I live in Dublin, Ireland, where I'm glad to say Burlesque is alive and well :-)
										<br/>I like to think I'm a small part of the wonderful world of Burlesque by providing other lovers of all things glamourous and gorgeous with tailored accessories.
										<p/>From stage divas to the girl or boy next door, I make <b>nipple tassels and pasties, garters, stocking toppers, collars, brooches, spats, bow-ties, eye-patches and more</b>.
										<p/>I make <b>items to measure</b>, designed especially for you with top-quality materials and an unmatched attention to detail.
										<p/>I also make <b>stock items</b> that you can buy "ready-made" and soon I will be providing a facility on the website to allow you to design your own accessories from the materials that I regularly keep in stock!
										<p/>I update this website regularly, so make sure to keep checking it. If you'd like to contact me, you can do so by <a href="contact.php">clicking here</a> or clicking on the pen icon at the bottom of any page on the site.
										<br/>You can also find me on
