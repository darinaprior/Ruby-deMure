										Luxury tassels and pasties designed and handmade with love xx
										<p/>Well hello there! My name is Ruby. I live in Dublin, Ireland, where I'm glad to say Burlesque is alive and well :-)
										<br/>I like to think I'm a small part of the wonderful world of Burlesque by providing other lovers of all things glamourous and gorgeous with tailored nipple adornments and other accessories.
										<br/>I make nipple tassels and pasties to measure, designed especially for you with top-quality materials and all the love a girl can put into tiny little things!
										<p/>I make items for stage performers and for those of us a little more - shall we say - demure!  I also make stock items that you can buy "ready-made" and soon I will be providing a facility on the website to allow you to design your own pasties from the materials that I regularly keep in stock!
										<p/>I update this website regularly, so make sure to keep checking it. If you'd like to contact me, you can do so by clicking on the "Contact Ruby" link at the bottom of the page (the pen icon).
										<br/>You can also find me on
