This git repository is the bulk of the codebase for the Ruby deMure website http://www.rubydemure.com
It largely consists of PHP and MySQL with various third-party javascript/jQuery plugins.
I have not included the third-party code here, though most of it is also open-source, so you can find those parts online.

The Ruby deMure code is quite out-of-date and needs a serious overhaul, so please excuse its crudeness!

All code (other than third-party plugins) written by Darina White from 2007 to date.
My code is open-source - use whatever you like :-)
